We are on the Madison Avenue that is only one block away from the central park. Our lab is about bioinformatics and currently there are two focuses:\r\n\r\n1. Large-scale next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis\r\n2. Novel software development for NGS analytics\r\n\r\n## Members\r\nI'm actively looking for a postdoc in bioinformatics with emphasis on NGS analysis and software. Interested?
